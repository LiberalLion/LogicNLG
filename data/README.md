Here we explain the data format for LogicNLG

## The training/dev/test LM file
The three files are used for training/testing all the models in the following format:
```
{
  table_id: [ 
    [
      sent1,
      linked columns1,
      table title,
      template1
    ],
    [
      sent2,
      linked columns2,
      table title,
      template2
    ],
    ...
  ]
  table_id: [
    ...
  ]
}
```
The template sentence is generated by using entity linking file, which is not 100% accurate, it could miss some numbers or entities. Besides that, to accelerate the dataloading, we also preprocess the training file to have train_lm_preprocessed.json, which appends the "linearized table" in each sentence.


## The adversarial evaluation file
These files are used for adversarial evaluation, where each sentence is paired with an adversarial example with mild modification to test model's sensitivity against logic errors. The data is in the following format:
```
{
  table_id: [ 
    {
      pos:[
        sent1,
        linked columns1,
        table title,
        template1        
      ]
      neg:[
        sent1-adv,
        linked columns1,
        table title,
        template1-adv        
      ]
    },
    {
      pos:[
        sent2,
        linked columns2,
        table title,
        template2  
      ]
      neg:[
        sent2-adv,
        linked columns2,
        table title,
        template2-adv
      ]    
    },
    ...
  ],
  table_id: [
    {
      ...
    },
    {
      ...    
    }
    ...
  ]
  ...
}
```
